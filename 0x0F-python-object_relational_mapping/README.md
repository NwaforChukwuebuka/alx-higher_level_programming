# Python Object-Relational Mapping Project

This project explores the concept of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python, focusing on the interaction between Python applications and MySQL databases. It demonstrates the use of various libraries and frameworks such as MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy for querying, creating, editing, and deleting tables in a MySQL database.

## Project Overview

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that converts data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. In this project, we delve into ORM in the context of MySQL databases using Python.

## File Descriptions

### 0-select_states.py

- Lists all states in the database hbtn_0e_0_usa using MySQLdb.
- Results are ordered by ascending states.id.

### 1-filter_states.py

- Lists all states with names starting with 'N' in the database hbtn_0e_0_usa using MySQLdb.
- Results are ordered by ascending states.id.

### 2-my_filter_states.py

- Displays all values matching a given state name in the states table of the database hbtn_0e_0_usa using MySQLdb.
- Results are ordered by ascending states.id.
- Uses string formatting to construct the SQL query.

### 3-my_safe_filter_states.py

- Displays all values matching a given state name in the states table of the database hbtn_0e_0_usa using MySQLdb.
- Results are ordered by ascending states.id.
- Provides protection against SQL injections.

### 4-cities_by_state.py

- Lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa using MySQLdb.
- Results are ordered by ascending cities.id.

### 5-filter_cities.py

- Lists all cities of a given state in the database hbtn_0e_4_usa using MySQLdb.
- Results are sorted by ascending cities.id.

### 6-11: SQLAlchemy Scripts

- These scripts interact with the MySQL database using SQLAlchemy, providing ORM capabilities.
- They perform various operations such as fetching, inserting, updating, and deleting data using SQLAlchemy models.

### 14-16: SQLAlchemy Relationships

- These scripts demonstrate relationships between tables using SQLAlchemy, such as one-to-many relationships between states and cities.

## Usage

Each script can be executed with appropriate arguments to connect to the MySQL database and perform the desired operation. Usage instructions are provided in the respective script descriptions above.

## Scripts

The scripts provided in this project cover a range of functionalities, from basic querying to more complex ORM operations using both MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy libraries.
